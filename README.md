# Thread Pool (C++17)

A lightweight, header-only **thread pool library** implemented in C++17.  
This project demonstrates **multithreaded programming, task scheduling, synchronization, and futures**, all essential for building high-performance systems.

---

## Features
- **Header-only** â€” just include and use
- Configurable number of worker threads
- Task enqueueing with return values via `std::future`
- Graceful shutdown on destruction
- Uses `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable` for synchronization

---
